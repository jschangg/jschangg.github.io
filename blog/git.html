      What are the benefits of Version Control?

      Version control helps an individual (coder) track and save changes to a file (code) and GitHub allows you to post the file online so that other coders may see and edit the file. you can then merge the changes down, while keeping track of who made the changes and when the changes were made.

      How does git help you keep track of changes?

      Git is a type of version control that allows you to make changes and save them as you progress. this could be for anything, like editing photos, code, documents etc. Github is a website when programmers can share their code, that was once just local to their computer, online so that others may, see, share and edit. Basically Git is local whereas Github is remote. And git and git hub work together where you can send files that you edited on your computer via Git and push it through to Github by using "git push" so that others may access it.

      Coders use version control like Git to help them keep track of changes they made to their code. However version control can literally be used for anything, to keep track of changes made to the "thing" (file) The cool and maybe the most intriguing thing about version control that makes it really attractive for coders is when a team of coders are working on one file together and even sometimes at the same time. At the end you can seamlessly merge the files together to the "master" branch

      Why should you use GitHub to store your code?

      There are a few reasons why GitHub is one of the best ways to store your code. First and foremost GitHub has become such a staple in the coding community, that being able to use it is almost a standard. Everyone does it so why shouldnt you?

      However, besides that GitHub is actually extremely efficient when it comes to working in teams. And if you know a bit about coding, most of the work is done in teams. GitHub allows multiple users to work on the sade code file at any given time. Not only does it allow multiplpe editors but its designed for seamless integration of those edits. Meaning you and your team can edit, save, and progress your code that much faster and thereby more efficiently.
