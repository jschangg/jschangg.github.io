      What are the benefits of Version Control?
</p>
<p>
      Version control helps an individual (coder) track and save changes to a file (code) and GitHub allows you to post the file online so that other coders may see and edit the file. you can then merge the changes down, while keeping track of who made the changes and when the changes were made.

      What is "version control", and why should you care? </p>
      <p>
      Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this book you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.

      How does git help you keep track of changes?
</p>
<p>
      Git is a type of version control that allows you to make changes and save them as you progress. this could be for anything, like editing photos, code, documents etc. Github is a website when programmers can share their code, that was once just local to their computer, online so that others may, see, share and edit. Basically Git is local whereas Github is remote. And git and git hub work together where you can send files that you edited on your computer via Git and push it through to Github by using "git push" so that others may access it.

      Coders use version control like Git to help them keep track of changes they made to their code. However version control can literally be used for anything, to keep track of changes made to the "thing" (file) The cool and maybe the most intriguing thing about version control that makes it really attractive for coders is when a team of coders are working on one file together and even sometimes at the same time. At the end you can seamlessly merge the files together to the "master" branch
