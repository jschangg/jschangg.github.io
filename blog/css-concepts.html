  <h1>What and Why Version Control</h1>
  <h2>Github yay? or nay?</h2>

      What are the benefits of Version Control?
</p>
<p>
      Version control helps an individual (coder) track and save changes to a file (code) and GitHub allows you to post the file online so that other coders may see and edit the file. you can then merge the changes down, while keeping track of who made the changes and when the changes were made.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is "version control", and why should you care? </p>
      <p>
      Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this book you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      How does git help you keep track of changes?
</p>
<p>
      Git is a type of version control that allows you to make changes and save them as you progress. this could be for anything, like editing photos, code, documents etc. Github is a website when programmers can share their code, that was once just local to their computer, online so that others may, see, share and edit. Basically Git is local whereas Github is remote. And git and git hub work together where you can send files that you edited on your computer via Git and push it through to Github by using "git push" so that others may access it.

      Coders use version control like Git to help them keep track of changes they made to their code. However version control can literally be used for anything, to keep track of changes made to the "thing" (file) The cool and maybe the most intriguing thing about version control that makes it really attractive for coders is when a team of coders are working on one file together and even sometimes at the same time. At the end you can seamlessly merge the files together to the "master" branch

<h1>The Daunting task of CSS</h1>
  <h2>Lets dwelve on some CSS concepts</h2>
  <h4>January 28, 2016</h4>
  <p>
What is the difference between margin, border, and padding?
</p>
<p>
  So what would you guess would be a border? What your thinking is exactly it, its simply just a border!
</p>
<p>
  Padding is the space that’s inside the element between the element and the border. Padding goes around all four sides of the content and you can target and change the padding for each side with CSS.
</p>
<p>
Margin is the space between the border and next element. The space outside the border between it and the other elements is the margin. Just like padding, it’s possible to target all four sides of an element to change it’s margin.
</p>
<p>
What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
<p>
  So what's the difference between classes and ids you ask? Well class is most useful when you have a bunch of elements that should all receive the same styling. Rather than repeating the same rule to multiple selectors, just assign the same class. It will then change everything in the same class as you want it. This will save you time and saving time is always great!
</p>
<p>
  Ids are quite the opposite, its usefule for one element that should receive a particular kind of styling. Quite straight forward right?
</p>
<p>
What are the differences between relative, absolute, fixed, and static positioning?
</p>
<p>
  So static is actually the default for every single page element. Different elements don't have different default values for positioning, they all start out as static. Static doesn't mean much, it just means that the element will flow into the page as it normally would.
</p>
<p>
Relative type of positioning is probably the most confusing and misused. What it really means is "relative to itself". If you set position: relative; on an element but no other positioning attributes (top, left, bottom or right), it will no effect on it's positioning at all, it will be exactly as it would be if you left it as position: static; But if you DO give it some other positioning attribute, say, top: 10px;, it will shift it's position 10 pixels DOWN from where it would NORMALLY be.
</p>
<p>
  So absolute positioning is a very powerful type of positioning that allows you to literally place any page element exactly where you want it. You use the positioning attributes top, left bottom and right to set the location. Remember that these values will be relative to the next parent element with relative (or absolute) positioning. If there is no such parent, it will default all the way back up to the <html> element itself meaning it will be placed relatively to the page itself.
</p>
<p>
  A fixed type of positioning is fairly rare but certainly has its uses. A fixed position element is positioned relative to the viewport, or the browser window itself. The viewport doesn't change when the window is scrolled, so a fixed positioned element will stay right where it is when the page is scrolled, creating an effect a bit like the old school "frames" days.

What does it mean to display inline vs using inline block?
<p>
  So an inline display respect left & right margins and padding but not top and bottom, it cannot have a width and height set , and it allows other elements to sit to their left and right.
</p>
<p>
  However, an inline block does everything a and inline can do with the addition of respecting top & bottom margins and padding as well as height and width.
